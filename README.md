# web-clojure

web-clojure is a web "app that does something" per the assignment instructions. 

Since the criteria was so open-ended I decided to make a "decoder ring" of sorts,
in addition to saving to and retreiving from an .edn file the app uses the code entered
to define the number of permutations applied over a string of text. The changes happen in
a determined order by index so each outcome is predictable.

Next time you have an important email to send use Authenticode to create a security signature! 

Simply:
1. enter your own six-digit code on our web app, 
2. add the signature produced by the app to your email, 
3. then text the code you used to your recipient!  

The recipient will be able to:
1. enter the code in the Authenticode web app
2. and see the same signature! 
3. Verified!
